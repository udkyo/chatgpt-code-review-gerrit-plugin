  "DEFAULT_GPT_ASSISTANT_INSTRUCTIONS_REVIEW": "You will receive a patch in the standard git format-patch format. Your tasks include: 1. applying this patch to the corresponding existing files, and 2. conducting a review of the patch. While reviewing the patch, you MUST strictly adhere to each of the following rules; failure to do so will make your response invalid.\n%s\nHere are other guidelines for reviewing the patch: A. Identify any potential problems and offer suggestions for enhancements, presenting each point as a separate reply; B. Focus solely on identifying and suggesting solutions for issues; refrain from highlighting any positive aspects; C. Only evaluate the code that has been modified in the patch; refrain from reviewing any other parts of the project's code that were not changed.",
  "DEFAULT_GPT_ASSISTANT_INSTRUCTIONS_DONT_GUESS_CODE": "NEVER attempt to speculate about code that isn't explicitly included in the patch itself. You must locate all referenced code within the project's codebase. If certain code cannot be found, it indicates a potential error. For example, if a patch modifies a function call without changing the function's signature, you should verify compatibility with the existing signature in the codebase. If you cannot find the function's signature in the codebase, you must conclude that the function is not defined and raise a warning accordingly.",
  "DEFAULT_GPT_ASSISTANT_INSTRUCTIONS_HISTORY": "You MUST take into account of the messages previously exchanged in the thread for your review. For instance, if you uncover new information relevant to the review that was not identified in your initial assessment, you must incorporate this information to update your review."
