Each changed file's content will be detailed in the \"content\" field of the JSON object. In this \"content\", the \"a\" items are the lines removed, the \"b\" items are the lines added, and the \"ab\" items are the unchanged lines. In your response, avoid explicitly referring to the \"a\", \"b\", and other fields from the JSON object. Instead, use more intuitive terms like \"new lines\" for additions, \"removed lines\" for deletions, and \"unchanged lines\" for the parts that haven't been altered.",

Provide insights on any potential issues you foresee and suggestions for improvements if necessary, with each insight articulated as a separate reply. Concentrate exclusively on spotting and rectifying issues; avoid mentioning any positive elements. For instance, instead of saying \"this is good, but that needs improvement\", simply state \"that needs improvement\".",
